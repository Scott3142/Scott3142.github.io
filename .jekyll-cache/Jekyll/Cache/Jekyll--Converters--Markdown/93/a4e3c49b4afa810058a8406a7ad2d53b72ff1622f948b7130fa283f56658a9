I"8<p>I am Digital Lead at Bridgend College and my remit is to enhance the delivery of the curriculum with emerging technologies and drive innovation across the curriculum; not just in IT or the STEAM subjects but in all areas, ensuring all of our learners have a deep understanding of the digital world and the technology it contains.
I have recently developed our Collegeâ€™s Digital Strategy in collaboration with our Deputy Principal Viv Buckley. This process has been a journey of co-construction and consultation and has resulted in a variety of learning opportunities. We engaged a Google professional development partner, Aspire 2Be, early on in the process who conducted a Digital Competence Review in December 2018, establishing a digital line in the sand for us to work from. Through subsequent Vision and Leadership sessions with Senior Leaders, Heads of Curriculum and in-house Learning Technologists, we co-constructed a bespoke plan of digital upskilling across our organisation. Through a series of two-day training sessions which to date has seen over 200 staff trained, our digital transformation is now well and truly underway and we owe a large part of that to Aspire 2Be. We feel that they truly share our People Centred values and have allowed us to strive towards technological innovation across the curriculum.</p>
