I"Ý<p>If anyone had said to me at 17 that I would be working for Bridgend College in 10 years time I wouldnâ€™t have believed them. Attending the College as a student was never really an option suggested to me at school - the traditional path, the A-Level path, was the <em>only</em> option, right? Bridgend College was seen to me as a non-starter, and by my own naive admission, I wouldnâ€™t have ever considered accepting a place to study for a Level 3 qualification there.</p>
