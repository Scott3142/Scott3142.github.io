      A Cardiff University workshop scheme aimed at inspiring secondary school students from traditionally disadvantaged areas to attend university. The workshops bridge several of the physical sciences including mathematics, computer science, engineering and chemistry. During the sessions, the students built and programmed a Lego spectrophotometer, carried out an experiment and analysed the data using a Raspberry Pi and a simple circuit.

      Several STEM Ambassadors from the School of Maths assisted in the on-the-day running of one the main one-day engagement projects run by Cardiff University. I was involved in the coordination of the STEM Ambassadors, the organisation of the event prior to the day and in collaboration with Joe Bishop, created ‘feedback collecting’ boxes which were utilised to collect data from participants in the day.
