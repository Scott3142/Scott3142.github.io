- blockname: Creating a Google Account
  blocktext: |
    <li>You will need a <em>Google account</em> to access many parts of this course. If you do not already have a Google account, create one now. | <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en" target = "_blank">Create Google account</a></li>
    
- blockname: Programming Software
  blocktext: |
    <li>For many of the examples and tasks throughout this course, we will use the programming language <em>Python</em>. There are many other programming languages but Python is freely available, easy to learn and arguably easier to use than some other programming languages.</li>
    <br/>
    <li>When writing a program you need two things:</li>
    <br/>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Something to save the code (a text editor for example)</li>
      <li>Something to run the code</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <li>We will be using <em>notebooks</em>, which handily combine the two.</li>

- blockname: Installing Python
  idtag: jupyter
  blocktext: |
    <li>We will use Anaconda to run our Python files, which comes packaged with a variety of other useful tools (including the notebooks I mentioned above).</li>
    <br/>
    <li>To install it on your personal machine follow these steps:</li>
    <br/>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Go to this webpage: <a href="http://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank">continuum.io/downloads</a>.</li>
      <li>Identify and download the version of Python 3 for Windows. If you do this on your home computer which isn't Windows, download the appropriate version at this stage.</li>
      <li>Run the installer.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    
    <li>We will use a <em>Jupyter</em> notebook which runs in your browser. To open a local notebook server, find the Continuum navigator and click on Jupyter. You do not need to be connected to the internet to use this.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Zk0RhwCiiNA" target="_blank">Click here for Dr. Vince Knight's video of how to open and use a notebook.</a></li>
    <br/>
    <li>Try the following:</li>
    <br/>
    <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello world"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="n">world</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <li>Congratulations! You have just written and run your first piece of Python code!</li>
    
- blockname: Creating an Account on Github
  idtag: github
  blocktext: |
    <li><em>Github</em> is a place online where you can store your codes for other people to read and download. Throughout this course we will make use of Github, both for downloading course materials and finding existing code to play with. Everyone enrolled is encouraged to create an account on Github and upload your files. Collaboration in the field of Computer Science is extremely important, and the more widely available our codes are the more this field will advance!</li>
    <br/>
    <li>To create an account on your personal machine follow these steps:</li>
    <br/>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Create a username and password at <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a></li>
      <li>Choose "Unlimited public repositories for free." Click Continue.</li>
      <li>Tick the appropriate boxes on the following screen. Click Submit.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <li><em>Feel free to have a browse around the pages on Github. Read the guide, start a project. Generally get a feel for it.</em></li>
