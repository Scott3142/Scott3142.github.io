On May 27th, the SIAM Student Chapter at Cardiff University were host to the 5th National Student Chapter Conference with plenary talks from Prof. Rene de Borst and Dr. Julie Vile, along with student talks from Cardiff, Swansea, Manchester & Warwick.

Prof. de Borst opened proceedings with a very interesting talk on the mechanics of fracture and fluid flow in porous media, and discussed physical and numerical methods for studying many different types of cracks in materials. Following the plenary lecture was the first of two sets of postgraduate student talks, with many interesting problems being discussed. Students from Cardiff, Swansea, Manchester & Warwick participated and also presented posters over lunch. Finishing up the day was Dr. Julie Vile of the NHS, a former student and lecturer at Cardiff University, discussing the use of Operational Research modelling to redesign many aspects of healthcare delivery. The real world application of this work is paramount, and Julieâ€™s work highlighted the difficulties involved with translating mathematics into real life.

Overall, I felt the day was a great success and was well attended by both members and non-members of SIAM. In particular I thought that everyone engaged very well with all of the talks and with the atmosphere of the event. It was great to see such a high level of integration between students and staff from several departments, and I am sure that this will continue at future events and conferences.
