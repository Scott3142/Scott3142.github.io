During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Python programming language. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using automatic testing via Github.

The slide deck is mapped to the scheme of work provided by Pearson and is designed to be a self-contained resource for the course.
