The Pi and Mash event was the follow up to the [SMILE Technology Workshops](/SMILE-Technology-Workshops/) and featured Year 5 and 6 children from 4 local primary schools - St. Mary & St. Partick, Litchard, Croesty and Brynmenyn. There were robots, Raspberry Pis, Makey Makey kits and LEGO and everyone had a great time experimenting with emerging technologies and creating interesting gadgets. The schools had been given a competition to design a robot chassis and there were some excellent designs submitted, including a flying iron, a unicorn, a flipper and a high-heeled shoe!

The Raspberry Pi session featured physical computing with simple motor control using <a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">gpiozero</a> and resources from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/training/picademy/" target="_blank">Picademy</a>, robot rally cars using the CamJam Edukits and <a href="http://sonic-pi.net" target="_blank">SonicPi</a>. We finished off with a race around the track which was won by Litchard!

The 2017 version of this event will feature more Raspberry Pi robotics and each school will get the opportunity to submit a final design to our application for <a href="http://piwars.org" target="_blank">PiWars</a> in Cambridge!
