On 21st & 22nd February, I attended a 2-day course for educators, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/training/picademy/" target="_blank">Picademy</a>. The days were broken up into several workshops aimed at developing skills using Raspberry Pi and Python. Focussed around Minecraft, SonicPi and Physical Computing, the classes started with the basics and built to be challenging for everyone. The second day consisted mostly of a project, and my project of choice was a motion-sensing CCTV streaming device. The code can be found on Github below, as well as some other interesting links. I strongly recommend this <em>free</em> to everyone in the IT education sector - it really was an invaluable experience!
