title: "Formation of New SIAM-IMA Student Chapter"
---

As of September 1st, the newly formed SIAM-IMA Student Chapter will begin operating, replacing the highly successful SIAM Student Chapter. An agreement between SIAM and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications has been recently reached, allowing the two institutes to work together to offer a wide range of opportunities to students.

The Chapter will include students and faculty members from across Cardiff University who are interested in mathematics or scientific computing and their real-world applications. As the first SIAM-IMA student chapter to be established in Wales, we will run several student-led activities throughout the year including conferences, seminars and social events.

Becoming a member of the chapter is free and open to any student in the final year of a BSc or MMath degree programme, Masters and PhD candidates, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty members of Cardiff University who are engaged or interested in mathematics or scientific computing and their applications.
