I went along to the Urdd since it was being held in my hometown of Pencoed for (perhaps?) the first time ever. We spent the days showcasing all that Bridgend College has to offer, but once again Si and Pepper were the stars of the show. This was a great event, and it was a pleasure to be a part of it!
