Between January 17th and 20th, I was involved in the long-running SMILE Technology Workshops at Bridgend College. The format of the week was to split Year 5 and 6 children from 4 local primary schools; St. Mary & St. Partick, Litchard, Croesty and Brynmenyn into several groups and run parallel sessions with interesting technology. We used Raspberry Pis, LEGO Mindstorms and Makey Makey to deliver a range of sessions based at giving the children a taste of fun and interesing technology. Students of the college ran the workshops, which were both highly successful and extremely professional.

The Raspberry Pi Session involved Minecraft, Python and robotics using the CamJam Edukit 3 sets and code written by <a href="https://picymru.org.uk" target="_blank">PiCymru</a>. We even had a selfie booth powered by a Raspberry Pi and the children designed their own robot chassis which are now in production ready for the SMILE Pi and Mash event in April! All in all, this was a great day which hopefully inspired a future cohort of STEAM practitioners. The same event will run next year, with more schools, new technologies and new ideas. Watch this space!
